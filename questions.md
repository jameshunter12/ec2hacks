<h1>Customization 1</h1>

<h2>1. What are some of the best practices for creating effective wire-frames in computer science? How do wire-frames help with the design process?</h2>
One practice that you can use is identifying the purpose and user needs, so before creating a wireframe, it is essential to identify the purpose of the project and the needs of the users. This will help to create a wireframe that meets the needs of the project and the users.

<h2>2. How does user testing play a role in the design of user interfaces and wire-frames in computer science? Can you provide an example of a project where user testing significantly impacted the final product design?</h2>
User testing is a crucial part of designing wireframes. User testing involves getting feedback from actual users on how they interact with the interface and identifying areas that need improvement. An example of this is you working on a website and then you ask for feeback and then you modify the website based on the feeback.

<h2>1. What are examples of selection, iteration, and sequencing in the snake game?</h2>
Selection: Uses an if statement that checks to see if your score is greater than your max and if it is it will replace the max score. Iteration: Uses a "for loop" to iterate through the snake until it reaches the correct length. Squencing is used all throughout the code.
<h2>2. How does ":root" contribute to the customization of the game?</h2>
The CSS selector :root enables you to set CSS variables that can be used in the entire program.
<h2>3. Write 2-3 sentences about how the use of HTML, JavaScript, and CSS creates the final product.</h2>
HTML is used to structure the content of a website, CSS is used to design and arrange the appearance of these elements, and JavaScript is used to add dynamic and interactive behavior to the website. These languages serve distinct purposes: HTML is a markup language, CSS is a styling-based markup language, and JavaScript is a traditional programming language.
